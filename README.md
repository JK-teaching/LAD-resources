# Learning Analytics (dashboards)

## Abstract
Learning analytics dashboards are one of the tools used to provide students with recommendations and feedback. The integration of pedagogical assumptions and information technology options is crucial to ensure that study and learning processes are appropriately supported by learning analytics. \
In this course, you will first gain an insight into learning analytics and dashboards as well as agile project management. You will then define functions for learning analytics and dashboards for students or teachers. You will implement these functionalities using an existing data set of student data. \
The aim of the semester project is to first define and then develop corresponding functions of learning analytics and dashboards. The development process will be documented in interim presentations and a final report.

## Schedule
Course is intended 16 weeks semester (+2 weeks holidays). The first part of the course provides brief introduction to the covered topics. Second part is more or less focusing on the group work on the task.
